#summary How the alignments were performed

=== Process of building the English-Vietnamese bilingual corpus: ===
1.* Raw Text Extraction:* The raw text was extracted from HTML files with using of the Majestic-12 Projects ([http://www.majestic12.co.uk/]). The HTML files were collected manually from the Internet.

2.* Sentence Splitter:* The raw text was split into sentences with OpenNLP's SentenceDetect ([http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/projects.html]).

3.* Vietnamese Word Segmentation:* The Vietnamese text were segmented Vietnamese words with Le Hong Phuong's vnTokenizer 4.1 ([http://www.loria.fr/~lehong/tools/vnTokenizer.php]) .

4.* POS Tagger for Vietnamese:* Vietnamese sentences were tagged POS with Le Hong Phuong's with vnTagger version 4.2.0 ([http://www.loria.fr/~lehong/tools/vnTagger.php]).

5.* Chunker for Vietnamese:* We build a chunker model to chunk Vietnamese sentences based on the VLSP data for chunker ([http://vlsp.vietlp.org:8080/demo/]) and the Yamcha toolkit for SVM model ([http://chasen.org/~taku/software/yamcha/]) .

6.* Chunker for English:* The English text were parsed with Stanford Parser ([http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/]) and mapped to get chunker result.

7.* Text Alignment:* The sentences were aligned at the word level with Phrase-based WA tool by NgoHung .

8. One-to-one correspondences were then extracted from the aligned data..
